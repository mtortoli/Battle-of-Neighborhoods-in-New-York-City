# Battle of Neighborhoods in New York City

## Introduction
NYC is a very famous city, which attracts many tourists and workers from all over the world.

Opening a business activity in this city can be very profitable but also very risky, as it is necessary to know well the neighborhoods. Not all neighborhoods in New York City are the same, and for each of them there can be advantages and disadvantages, for example, a less famous neighborhood can attract less tourists, but there will probably be less competition. 

The challenge is to find the best neighborhood/area to open an italian restaurant/pizzeria.

## Business Problem
A restaurant business manager wants to open an italian restaurant/pizzeria in New York City, but he does not know which is the best neighborhood to open it in. So, the target audience are the restaurant/pizzeria business managers. 

it's important to understand which is the right neighborhood to open this kind of activity, because in NYC there are already many italian restaurant/pizzeria activities, and therefore opening it in the right neighborhood can make the difference.

## Data
The dataset will be taken using this link --> https://geo.nyu.edu/catalog/nyu_2451_34572.

This dataset contains all the geographical informations about New York City:
* Borough
* Neighborhood
* Latitude
* Longitude

To solve the problem is necessary to explore the boroughs/neighborhoods and findd competing activities and also the tourist attractions (museum, monuments, etc).

For example, a good place to open an italian restaurant/pizzeria could be one close to the attractions but at the same time with few competitors in the same neighborhood.
